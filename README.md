# 📘 DSA-Solutions (C Programs)
This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems in **C language**.  
Each file focuses on a specific problem or concept, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, etc.

## 🔹 Structure
- Each program is written in a separate `.c` file.
- The file name indicates the problem (e.g., `BST_KEYSUM.c` for "Two Sum in BST").
- Programs can be compiled and run independently.

---

## 🔹 How to Compile and Run

1. Open terminal inside the repo folder.
2. Compile a program:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o filename



**"Two Sum IV - Input is a BST"**
Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

Features
Build a BST from user input.
Search for two numbers that add up to a target sum.
Returns TRUE if such a pair exists, otherwise FALSE.

HOW TO RUN
1. Open a terminal in the project folder
2. Compile the program:
    gcc BST_KEYSUM.C -o BST_KEYSUM
3. Run the executable:
    .\BST_KEYSUM

CONCEPTS USED
1. Binary Search Tree
2. Inorder Traversal
3. Two pointer on sorted list
