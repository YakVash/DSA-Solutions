# ðŸ“˜ DSA-Solutions (C & Java Programs)
This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems in **C & Java language**.  
Each file focuses on a specific problem or concept, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, etc.

## ðŸ”¹ Structure
- Each program is written in a separate `.c` file.
- The file name indicates the problem (e.g., `BST_KEYSUM.c` for "Two Sum in BST").
- Programs can be compiled and run independently.
