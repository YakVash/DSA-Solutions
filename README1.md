**Two Sum IV - Input is a BST**
Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

Features
Build a BST from user input.
Search for two numbers that add up to a target sum.
Returns TRUE if such a pair exists, otherwise FALSE.

HOW TO RUN in C
1. Open a terminal in the project folder
2. Compile the program:
    gcc BST_KEYSUM.C -o BST_KEYSUM
3. Run the executable:
    .\BST_KEYSUM

HOW TO RUN in Java
1. Open a terminal in the project folder
2. Compile the program:
    javac BST_KEYSUM.java
3. Run the executable:
    java BST_KEYSUM

CONCEPTS USED
1. Binary Search Tree
2. Inorder Traversal
3. Two pointer on sorted list

**Two Sum II - Input Array is sorted**

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
You may not use the same element twice.
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
Your solution must use only constant extra space.

âœ… Example
Input
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Output
[1, 2]

Explanation
numbers[1] + numbers[2] = 2 + 7 = 9
So, the answer is [1, 2].

ðŸ’¡ Approach

Since the array is sorted, a two-pointer technique works efficiently.

Initialize two pointers:
left = 0 (start of array)
right = numbers.length - 1 (end of array)

While left < right:
Compute sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]

If sum == target, return [left+1, right+1]
If sum < target, move left forward to increase sum
If sum > target, move right backward to decrease sum
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
